## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

### Planned Features

1. **Knowledge Graph Integration**:
    - **Objective**: Enhance the chatbot's ability to understand and provide more accurate responses by integrating a knowledge graph.
    - **Technology**: Use Neo4j for the knowledge graph database.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Set up a Neo4j database.
        2. Define the schema for the knowledge graph.
        3. Integrate Neo4j with the chatbot.
        4. Develop functions to query the knowledge graph.
        5. Update the chatbot logic to utilize the knowledge graph for responses.

2. **Multi-Language Support**:
    - **Objective**: Enable the chatbot to support multiple languages to cater to a broader audience.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Identify the target languages.
        2. Implement language detection.
        3. Integrate translation APIs (e.g., Google Translate).
